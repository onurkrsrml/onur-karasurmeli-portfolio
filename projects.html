                <p>This project, which predicts fraud in financial transactions, aims to identify the best approaches by comparing the performance of different machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing using Python, balancing imbalanced classes with SMOTE, model training, and evaluation. It also provides a Streamlit interface that allows users to upload their own data and perform interactive analysis.</p>
